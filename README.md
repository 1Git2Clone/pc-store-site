# PC-store-site

An online store site for my school.

TBA:
- Proper about me
- Proper login and logout system
  - ^ Using XAMPP & PHP (depressing)
- More details for the store

### - All of that in Bulgarian as well...

I asked my teacher if we can use any web framework.
- "no"

Pretty depressing considering just how much boiler plate there is to do...
We don't even use Lavarel PHP at school...
